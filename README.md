# Insurance-image-search

The python notebook included in this repository contains a basic script that lets the user perform similarity search using [Atlas Vector Search](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-vector-search).
The steps are the following:

1 Define an image embedder based on a pytorch version of squeezenet
2 Download and save to file the public "car damage" dataset. The dataset contains images of car damages
3 Connect to MongoDB Atlas
4 Get image embeddings and load them to Atlas
5 Run an image similarity query
